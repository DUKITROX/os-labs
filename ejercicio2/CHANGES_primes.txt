Changes from "primes copy.c" (old) to "primes.c" (new)

1) Argument parsing in main
- Fixed assignment-as-condition bug: `if (argc = 2)` -> `if (argc == 2)`.
- Corrected argument index and assignment: `atoi(argv[2]);` -> `n = atoi(argv[1]);`.

Effect: Program now correctly accepts a single numeric argument and uses it for `n`.

2) Sum accumulation logic
- Initialized accumulator: `int total;` -> `int total = 0;`.
- Fixed typo in accumulation: `total =+ arr[i];` -> `total += arr[i];`.

Effect: Sum now accumulates correctly instead of overwriting with the current element.

3) Prime generation loop (compute_primes)
- Removed increment-on-prime-only: deleted `x += 2;` inside the `if (is_prime(x))` block.
- Added unconditional increment each iteration: `x++;` after the `if` block.

Effect: Prevents infinite loop when `x` is not prime and ensures all numbers are checked.

4) Primality check (is_prime)
- Handle numbers < 2 as non-prime: replaced `if (x % 2 == 0)` with `if (x < 2)` at start.
- Changed divisor loop to start at 2 and increment by 1: `for (int i = 3; i < x; i += 2)` -> `for (int i = 2; i < x; i++)`.

Effect: Correctly treats 2 as prime and checks all valid divisors (simpler but less efficient than sqrt optimization).

Summary of impact
- Fixes a hang/infinite loop during prime generation.
- Corrects command-line argument handling and prevents out-of-bounds access.
- Ensures the sum is computed correctly from initialized state.
- Makes primality test logically correct for all x >= 0.
